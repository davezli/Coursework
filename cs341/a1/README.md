Given an array A = A[1...n] consisting of n distinct integers and an integer S, determine the number OP of ordered pairs (i,j) such that A[i] + A[j] = S.

The input to your program will be from stdin, in the following order: S, n, followed by the contents of array A starting at the first index. One number per line.

The output of your program, OP, should be sent to stdout.

a) Implement an algorithm that computes OP in O(n log n)
b) Assuming that the array is sorted (in increasing order), implement an algorithm that computes OP in O(n).
